![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loch-nis/hike-app/refs/heads/main/demo.gif)

Hike app with a Laravel backend and a React frontend + Tailwind for styling.

Supports real-time checklist updates using Laravel Reverb.

Backend testing is done with Pest PHP - frontend testing with Vitest.
Backend test coverage is at 66.7% - frontend testing I have just begun to implement.

Token-based authentication with ``tymon/jwt-auth`` - authorization with Laravel Policies.
